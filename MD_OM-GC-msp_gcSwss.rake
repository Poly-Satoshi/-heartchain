Thing is out of no where security bothering me. When I was a kid I had a step dad named Mark. I'm not sure why he's still security and my Walmart so I have a few hoops to jump through before I deliver the gift card. I gotta hit past security, my old step dad mark damon. Reason I'm surprised is I've had my own Walmart for a long time and he was never security there. Babe. I still have it!

    c irvine interview.
voluntary 1111$The dream was Mark had a "beater" it was an old 4 wheel drive vehicle with chains on the tires he used to plow the driveway cuz in Vermont we got a lot of snow. It was fun growing up in Vermont as a kid because I even remember watching you on my tube TV back in the early 90s (the reason security stalks me is because the tube TV told them on jerked off on my tube TV with you on it in 1992 in vermont?). 
So in the dream Mark takes the beater and uses it to tow the 30 foot motor home we had off of the cliff I backed the rear tire off . We had a 30 foot motor home my mom Holly and step dad Mark used to drive me and my half brother's Ben and Aaron all round the country in. We left in January and then we got stuck in New Jersey first night in a snow storm. Then we drove to ft. Lauderdale and flew to Honduras for 3 months because my mom's dad owned land there that was seized by the Honduran government after my grandpa died and we had to go fence off the land so they could sell it. We flew back to Florida then drove through Texas to California then up the coast to the Sierra Nevada then over the rockies in Colorado through Ohio and back to Vermont it was a fun trip cuz I saw about 30% of the country but really I was only into magic the gathering and Mark was very mean to me about my magic the gathering because I just wanted to go to a local card shop and trade cards so it was very depressing and my step dad Mark was very mean to me and it was basically obvious he wanted me dead. So now that I'm older and still playing magic the gathering I can't figure out why I'm still having pointless nightmares and dreams with Mark damon as a main character. Now that I'm an adult, I raised my own family, and now I live in LA and I'm trying to do my own lady gaga thing. Idk Alyssa if you suffer from bad dreams about people you were around a lot and did fun things with, it's not like I live in LA because I'm looking to hang out with people and do fun things ok. I'm currently in Reseda CA. I'm gonna take anlook at my magic thr gathering today Alyssa because I made a new satanic Gothic cult which I have summon anti christ and 666 code for. Will you join my cult? Can we do some blood sacrifice together?
( 1992 )
